Type of Final Production Database: 

-Relational - Postgres

Findings:
-In searching through the data for mass shootings, we found that most datasets did not definitively define “mass shootings”, thus making it difficult to pull data that utilized the same definition. In the datasets that we are utilizing, we reviewed the data to determine the general definition (i.e. if the data sets defined “mass shooting” as 3 or more people being shot, or 4 or more people being shot). The goal is to utilize this data to create a database with all mass shootings (3 or more shooting victims) from 1971-2022 in the United States to utilize for specific trends in mass shootings and possible prevention policies or measures.
